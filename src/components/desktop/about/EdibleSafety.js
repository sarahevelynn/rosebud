        <p>The best kept secret to edibles: Go slow. </p>
        <p>
          It’s recommended that you start out with a single serving until you
          know exactly how edibles affect you. Everyone is different, and that’s
          especially true when it comes to the way your body metabolizes these
          tasty treats. Edibles could take two hours, or sometimes even longer,
          to take effect and could last anywhere from two to eight hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          So remember, patience is a virtue! The worst way to ruin a good time
          indulging in our ice cream is consuming more THC than desired. Start
          with a single serving and you might be surprised you don’t even need
          or want another serving!{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Please also be aware that the affects of edibles can be much different
          than the affects of smoking cannabis, so even if you typically smoke
          flower, please, take the edibles slow! Don’t mix with alcohol or other
          controlled substances and keep all of our treats out of reach of
          children & pets!{" "}
        </p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
