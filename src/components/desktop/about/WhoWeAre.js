          As lifelong lovers of ice cream & marijuana, the concept for
          marijuana-infused ice cream is more than just a good idea to us at
          RoseBud - it’s a passion. Our ice cream started from humble beginnings
          in mom’s kitchen. Snagging a $40 dollar ice cream machine and some
          fresh ingredients, we quickly learned that making ice cream was much
          more difficult than eating it. After countless batches, flavors, and
          techniques - we created something worth tasting. We created RoseBud
          Ice Cream.

          The marriage of ice cream and marijuana is a simple concept, but we
          knew it was only worth doing if it was done right. In an age where
          edibles are dominated by oils and concentrates, we wanted to give a
          nod to the roots of marijuana - or rather the flowers. All of our ice
          creams are infused with Colorado-grown marijuana flowers to create a
          beautifully balanced flavor that accents that comforting, indulgent
          ice cream taste.
