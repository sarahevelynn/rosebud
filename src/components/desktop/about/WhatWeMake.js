          The way we look at it, the marijuana in our ice cream is just an added
          bonus to an already tremendous frozen treat. Our first three flavors
          are a fun twist on the traditional staples of ice cream.

          Vanilla Chilla, Berry High, and Mountain Mint

          (Have pictures below each flavor of each package)

        <p>
          Rest assured each one of these delicious flavors has been tasted and
          perfected, but we believe ice cream shouldnâ€™t just taste great, it
          should be made from great ingredients as well. That is why each of
          these flavors has been created with the best ingredients available
          from our local suppliers.

          We offer our signature flavors in 2 sizes, 10 oz as well as ___(insert
          oz of smaller single serving size)____. Both contain only one legal,
          single dose of active THC. Our thought was we wanted you to be able to
          eat as much of our ice cream as your heart desires without
          overindulging in the marijuana aspect of our product. The pint being
          for when you want to indulge in the flavor, and the single serving
          being for when you want to indulge in the experience.

          We are currently taking suggestions for new flavors! Tell us what you
          want to taste next and you never know - you just might find it on the
          shelf at your local dispensary!
