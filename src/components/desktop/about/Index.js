        <h1> About Us </h1>
        <p>
          Our ice cream started from humble beginnings in Sam’s mother’s
          kitchen. With a $40 dollar ice cream machine and some fresh
          ingredients, we quickly learned that making ice cream was much more
          difficult than eating it. After countless batches, flavors, and
          techniques, we created something worth sharing with the world: RoseBud
          Ice Cream.
        </p>
        <p>
          The marriage of ice cream and marijuana is a simple concept. However,
          we knew it was only worth doing if it was done right. In an era where
          edibles are dominated by oils and concentrates, we wanted to give a
          nod to the roots of marijuana – or rather the flowers. All of our ice
          creams are infused with Colorado-grown marijuana flowers to create a
          beautifully balanced flavor that accents our ice cream flavors.

          We, at RoseBud, count ourselves lucky to be able to make our products
          and share them with the world. And because we love what we do, we make
          sure to hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards in bringing
          our customers the best possible product. This is our responsibility as
          a company. As citizens with the freedom to use marijuana, there is
          also an individual responsibility to consume any marijuana product,
          including RoseBud Ice Cream, safely.

          We believe ice cream shouldn’t just taste great, it should be made
          from great ingredients as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t believe in telling people what to do, but as a team of
          cannabis lovers who do not enjoy the consumption of concentrates, it
          didn’t feel right to use anything but marijuana flowers to make our
          product. That is why all of RoseBud’s amazing products have been
          carefully crafted using the finest cannabis our Colorado cultivators
          have to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here at RoseBud we are all about giving our customers exactly what
          they want and truly believe there is no such thing as a “bad” ice
          cream flavor. Therefore, we want to give everyone who loves our
          product the opportunity to suggest new flavors of our
          marijuana-infused ice cream. Give it a go and you never know – you
          just might find it on the shelf at your local dispensary in the
          future!
